Mutual funds are investment vehicles that pool money from multiple investors to create a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, and other securities, managed by professional fund managers. These funds allow investors to benefit from long-term market growth while mitigating risks through diversification. Creating a mutual fund plan involves selecting stocks that offer strong potential for long-term gains. By analyzing historical market performance, investors can identify stocks that align with their financial goals and risk tolerance. Understanding how to construct a mutual fund plan is crucial for making informed investment decisions.  

To develop a mutual fund plan using Python, we can follow a structured approach based on data analysis. The process begins by gathering historical stock data, such as closing prices and market trends, to assess past performance. Key financial metrics like Return on Investment (ROI) and volatility are then calculated to determine each stockâ€™s profitability and risk level. Stocks with a strong ROI and relatively low volatility are prioritized to strike a balance between returns and stability. Finally, by factoring in expected ROI, we can estimate the future value of monthly investments, helping investors plan their financial growth effectively.
